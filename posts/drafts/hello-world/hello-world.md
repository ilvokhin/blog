This is a post to demonstrate and test content generation code. I am not a
writing master, so I am going just enumerate features I am going to use to see
how they are rendered.

And I want to know how multiple paragraphs are rendered.


## Code

Standalone code block like this one.

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

And embedded code like `this` and `this`.


## Lists
* I
* like
* itemized
* lists

Also, sometimes I use enumerated lists like this one.

1. One.
2. Two.
3. Three.


## Formatting

This is a **bold** text. And this is _italic_.


## Quotes

> understanding; they learn by some other way â€” by rote or something.
> Their knowledge is so fragile!


## Footnotes

Oh, some it would nice to have footnotes like this one[^1].

[^1]: This should work.


## URLs

Here is the url to [website][1]. And the same [url](https://ilvokhin.com), but
embedded into the text.
