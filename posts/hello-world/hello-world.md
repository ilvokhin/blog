I decided to create a blog to occasionally share something interesting there.

I wanted something fast (in case I'll write something that made it to the
Hacker News front page), simple and easy to maintain. Nothing will be ever
faster than serving a static content, so I started looking into static site
generators. But why to use something ready, when you can invent your own wheel,
right?
